# Elanor
*This is restored version of original Kubera's Elanor repository* 

Elanor launcher is part of LotRO Rusification Project (http://translate.lotros.ru/)
This is a desktop C# application, which is used to install and implement russian translations into LotRO .dat files. 
After Kubera exit, maintenance of this application is continued by Gi1dor and Coder, and will be stopped after creating new, 
free-for-all launcher.
